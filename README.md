# NX-Cheats

*This is not a reboot of this repository*

However, due to my recent interest (see [AMSCheatTool](https://github.com/MCMi460/AMSCheatTool)), I want to have a repository to compile my personally-created cheat codes.  
My solution is **simple**. I will leave all of the previous things on the [master branch](https://github.com/MCMi460/NX-Cheats/tree/master), and all of my new things on this branch!
